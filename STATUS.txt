PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* For https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53119
  Prevent possible overflow exception with buffer in
  AjpNioProcessor.output() if it is called again after previous write
  failed with IOException.
  I have not observed it, but it is from analogy with AjpAprProcessor fix
  in r1344253.
